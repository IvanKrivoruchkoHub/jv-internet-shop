Select DB implementation in /jv-internet-shop/src/main/java/mate/academy/internetshop/factory/DaoAndServiceFactory.
By default it uses the MySQL implementation.

If you choose MySQL implementation then:
 * Use file /jv-internet-shop/src/main/resources/init_db.sql to create schema and all the tables required by this app in MySQL database.

By default there are one user with an USER role (login = "User1", password = "1") 
and one with an ADMIN role (login = "Admin1", password = "1").
